The suppression of the energetic particle (EP) driven mode is essential for the realization of the fusion reactor. Modification of the local plasma parameters, based on the stability analysis using FAR3D, successfully suppresses the EP driven interchange mode observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD). The achieved temperature is thereby improved significantly. Control of the EP driven interchange mode by the RMP application is demonstrated as well.
